# project1

Our goal was to create a dynamic webpage using JS, CSS, HTML, jQuery, and two API's (seatgeek API and google maps API).  

We wanted to create something practical that would have utility for people who want to go to concerts in an area.  For instance, if someone was travelling to Philadelphia for the weekend and wanted to go to a rap concert, they could search our app using those parameters and get results and links to buy tickets for relevant concerts.  

We utilized the Google Maps API and the Seatgeek API for this project.  We take the latitude and longitude from input into the Google Maps API and use those parameters to search the Seatgeek API for concerts near that location.  We also have added parameters, such as genre (selectable in a dropdown menu) and number of results per page (also selectable in a dropdown).  

In the future, we hope to add more parameters (such as date and distance to concert) to make user experience more complete.  Additionally, we hope to add a feature that allows the user to sort their results by these parameters, and more interactable map markers that show the location of the concert.
